# The Geometry of Truth: Dataexplorer

This page contains a plethora of interactive charts for exploring the data from the paper *The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets* by Samuel Marks and Max Tegmark.

## Basic datasets

Let's start off with our basic datasets, containing simple statements like "The city of Beijing is in China" (true) or "Fifty-eight is larger than sixty-one" (false). You can see which statements the points shown correspond to by mousing over.
